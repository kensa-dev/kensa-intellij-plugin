# Kensa IntelliJ Plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Project view context menu — right-click any folder to open Kensa reports found below it; one menu item per output directory, sorted alphabetically. Works across multi-module Gradle and Maven projects
- Ignored/disabled test state with amber gutter icon, in addition to existing pass/fail icons
- Configurable output directory name — Settings → Tools → Kensa → Output directory name (default: `kensa-output`), for projects that customise the Kensa output path

### Changed
- Gutter icons now appear on project open if output already exists, without requiring a file change or test run in the IDE
- Stale gutter icons are removed immediately when `indices.json` is rewritten (e.g. after running a subset of tests)
- Class-level gutter icon shown only when at least one method in that class appears in the index
- Method gutter icons shown only for methods present in the index

## [0.6.6]
### Fixed
- Plugin display name capitalisation on JetBrains Marketplace
- Synchronise with required Kensa version

## [0.6.5]
### Added
- Gutter icons showing pass/fail status for `@Test` and `@ParameterizedTest` methods and their containing classes
- Click gutter icon to open the Kensa HTML report in your browser, navigating directly to the relevant test or class
- CI report URL template support — configure a remote report URL in Settings → Tools → Kensa
- Console hyperlinks — `Kensa Output :` marker in test output becomes a clickable link to the report
- Live balloon notification when a new Kensa report is written, with an Open Report action
- Context menu action in the test tree to open a specific test in the browser
